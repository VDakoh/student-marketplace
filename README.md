# BUSHOP - Student Marketplace

### Overview
This is the repository for my current final-year project: a full-stack student marketplace application. It is currently a work in progress and serves as my hands-on learning environment for building full-stack architecture.

### Tech Stack
* **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot 
* **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Database / Architecture:** Relational Database Design, SQL, User/Admin Role Management

### Current Focus
I am actively developing the backend architecture, specifically focusing on database schemas, secure role management, and structuring the API endpoints to connect with the React frontend. I am using this project to formalize my development skills and transition toward production-level engineering environments.
